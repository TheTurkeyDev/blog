Welcome to my blog! I've resurrected this blog to better log my programming and diy project adventures, both the things that make it into YouTube and Twitch content, but also the things that don't. Text is searchable, unlike videos, so I feel having this all written down provides another layer of indexing of my projects, but also a way for me to just write down whatever I want from my perspective and be able to look back at it in the future.

This blog was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and you can view the [source code](https://github.com/TheTurkeyDev/blog) of it all! If you see a spelling mistake I guess you can make a PR and fix it ðŸ˜‚. I'm not the best at writing and all of this, but maybe this will help me get better.

At any rate, let me know what you think and hopefully over time I will be able to provide supplementary content here that goes a bit more in depth or technical... we'll see.
